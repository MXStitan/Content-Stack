For Russia, it was the loss of one of the country's most advanced fighter jets. Ukraine's military shared photos on social media showing the wreckage of an Su-35S multi-role fighter jet, the first loss in the war. Ukraine's aging air defence network allegedly shot down the large, twin-tailed fighter jet, often characterised as a fifth-generation fighter, just without the stealth. The Su-35S is an evolution of the Cold War-era Su-27 Flanker, a dedicated air superiority heavy fighter. Ukrainian Air Force experts have obtained important and so far confidential information about this fighter aircraft from its burnt remains and information about it was also sent to the British intelligence agency.

      "content": "Why summers spark off more vehicle fire incidents, causes and prevention? A moving car caught fire on Gurugram-Delhi Expressway. Soon the fire engulfed the entire car. Fortunately, there was no casualty in this incident. The person on the driver seat was quick to move out of the burning car into safety. The moving car caught fire near the Signature Tower of Gurugram. By the time the fire was brought under control by the firefighters, the car was completely burnt. However, the cause of the fire in the car is not yet known. But the good part is that a major accident was averted as the driver sensing smoke was coming out immediately got out of the car. The fire brigade was informed about it by passersbys who reached the spot and made a lot of effort to control the fire. The onset of summer every year is usually accompanied by a rise in fire incidents. Incidents of vehicles catching fire, particularly during summers often hits headlines. Data shared by the fire departments show an upward graph in the summer months. So, here we try to understand the cause behind rising fires. During summer, filling the petrol tank up to the brim could also cause a fire since the fuel inside would be hot and there is enough heat outside.
